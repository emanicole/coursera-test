    <p class = "descript">“You like Taylor Swift?” Millions of people around the world can answer that question with a resounding yes. Myself included. But when I brought up going to the Taylor Swift Eras Tour on a somewhat whim, some of my closest friends and family were different levels of puzzled. But Taylor cuts even deeper. In the time my friends and I spend, when we’re too afraid to bare our souls to each other for the umpteenth time about the same anxieties, Taylor fills the silence between the road trips, dinners and trips to the bar. Without a single original word, it’s brought us closer. It was that night, at the Eras Tour, that I finally realized – all along, there was an invisible string tying me to Taylor.</p>

    <p class = "descript">If you’ve hung around here for very long, you know that I love, love, LOVE summer.  It’s the static electricity shocks; the dry, cracked, itchy skin; the bundling up of the children in coats and hats and mittens; the waking up in the dark; the eating dinner in the dark; the overcast skies for days on end; the getting out of the shower in the cold bathroom; the getting into a cold car; the getting out of bed in the cold bedroom; the list goes on.  But no one likes a complainer. Or so my mom always told me. Of course, even though I also like winter (but mostly Christmas, who am I fooling?), summer has always been my favourite, and, let's be honest, there really is a lot to look forward to. But I already miss all those lazy days — reading on the beach, the heat of the sun, the afternoons spent by the pool, flip-flops and tank tops, warm summer nights hanging out by the street while the kids run and play, the aroma of fresh meat sizzling on the grill… What do YOU miss most about summer?</p>

    <p class = "descript">'Blog in Tandem' is our soul project, where me and my mum have worked as a mother-daughter team, since August 2014. Here, we want to gather special moments, of family and life, exactly as they happen and as we feel them. The blog is a gift that my mum gave to me and I give it back to her, in return.It's where we want our diary of memories, the place where we proposed and promised ourselves that we would tell our thoughts, special moments, fears, life lessons, shared memories. We will also make room here for dreams, plans, inspirations, experiments, beautiful stories from us or from others. HERE is where it all started!</p>

    <p class = "descript">these days, I've been feeling 'homesick' from all of Tolkien's creations and his world (and for some Bagginshield, who am I kidding?), and I decided to rewatch - or, at least, rewind through the whole triolgy I was so in love with - even if, book-wise, I haven't always liked it! Perhaps a little late to post this now, but better than never I guess! So here’s my review on the first installment of ‘The Hobbit’ Trilogy, written after copious amounts of repeat viewings and the span of a few months. A word of warning: I haven’t divided this post into different parts, resulting in a rather lengthy review. I’ve added screen-caps in order to both reference the text, as well as to provide some “colour” and life to the thousands of words that follow… And as always, some spoilers from the book will be present – but I have ‘blanked out’ the relevant phrases, so all you need to do to read the spoiler is to highlight it with your mouse. Read on if you dare!</p>

    <p class = "descript">I am not a fan of the tradition of making New Year’s resolutions. For two reasons. Firstly, because resolutions do not work. They are actually just wishes or dreams with no target date. They are usually defined in such a generic way (“enjoy life more”, “learn something new”) that do not involve any specific action you should take to achieve them. It is like trying to win the lottery without purchasing any ticket. You know it’s not going to happen. And secondly, because even if resolutions were well defined—not as desires, but as achievable goals—, they do not have to have anything to do with the calendar year. You should set goals when you need to achieve things, no matter the season it is. Moreover, the time it takes you to reach them can vary. It can take one month or two years, depending on how big or small the goal is, the time you can spend on it and how effective you are. However, this year I do have a resolution, if you will. I want to improve a skill that is essential for most things I face every day, from performing tasks effectively to maintaining healthy interpersonal relationships: My attention.</p>

    <p class = "descript">Listen, usually I have trouble with deciding how I’ll start my reviews. This time, I think the best way is telling you that if you have already read this book and want to know my full and very spoilery opinion, you can find it on my Goodreads. I usually don’t have the need to do two versions of my reviews (usually just the spoiler-free one is enough), but this time I had the aching need to get my thoughts out there, all of them. So there’s that (warning: it’s a long ass review with over 1k words… just like this one). However, if you haven’t read this book yet and wish to read my spoiler-free, most civilized version of the review, keep on reading.</p>
